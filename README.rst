Experiment
===============================

Create and manage AB tests

Features:
* Define experiments with multiple variants
* Query for the variant to serve for a particular user/session
* Update variant allocation after experiment has started
* User assignment is 'sticky' (will not change, even if the allocation has changed)
* Finalise an experiment, choosing one variant as the winner
